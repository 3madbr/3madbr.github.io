I’m Emad, a PhD student in the Computer Vision Group at the [University of Bonn](https://www.uni-bonn.de/en/home?set_language=en), supervised by [Prof. Jürgen Gall](https://pages.iai.uni-bonn.de/gall_juergen/).

I’m a research intern at Microsoft, working on Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) for video perception and reasoning.

My current research focuses on understanding how Multimodal LLMs handle temporal information and exploring ways to improve their performance for fine-grained video understanding. Previously, I focused on temporal action segmentation and long-term dense anticipation.


Prior to my PhD, I was a researcher at the [Deep MI](https://deep-mi.org/), where I developed deep learning methods for semantic segmentation of brain MRI scans. I also spent time as a visiting researcher in the Computer Vision Group, working on action recognition and future frame prediction, also under the supervision of Prof. Jürgen Gall.
