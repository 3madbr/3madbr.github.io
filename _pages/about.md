I am a PhD Student at Computer Vision Group at [University of Bonn](https://www.uni-bonn.de/en/home?set_language=en)
supervised by [Prof. Jürgen Gall](https://pages.iai.uni-bonn.de/gall_juergen/).
My current research focuses on video understanding including temporal action segmentation. I am interested in developing
methods for untrimmed video understanding.

Previously, I was a researcher at [Deep MI](https://deep-mi.org/) lab developing deep learning-based methods
for semantic segmentation of brain MRI scans. Prior to starting my PhD, I was a visiting researcher at
the [Computer Vision Group](https://pages.iai.uni-bonn.de/gall_juergen/)
working on action recognition and future frame prediction under supervision of Prof. Jürgen Gall.
Before University of Bonn, I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Tehran.
