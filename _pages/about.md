I’m Emad, a PhD student in the Computer Vision Group at the [University of Bonn](https://www.uni-bonn.de/en/home?set_language=en), supervised by [Prof. Jürgen Gall](https://pages.iai.uni-bonn.de/gall_juergen/). My primary research area is video understanding, currently focused on enhancing temporal modeling in Multimodal LLMs. Previously, I worked on tasks such as temporal action segmentation and long-term dense anticipation.
I’m currently a research intern at Microsoft, working on Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) for video perception and reasoning. 


Before starting my PhD, I was a researcher at [Deep MI](https://deep-mi.org/), specializing in semantic segmentation of human brain MRI scans. Additionally, I spent time as a visiting researcher in the Computer Vision Group, focusing on action recognition and future frame prediction, also under the supervision of Prof. Gall. I completed my bachelor's degree at the University of Tehran.
